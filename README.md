AtliQ Mart, a prominent retail player boasting a network of more than 50 supermarkets across Southern India, orchestrated an extensive promotional campaign across all its stores during the festive seasons of Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. The Sales Director is keen on deciphering the success and shortcomings of these promotions, aiming to glean valuable insights that will guide judicious decisions for future promotional endeavors.
To address the business challenge at hand, I employ SQL queries to analyze the performance of AtliQ Mart's promotional campaigns during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. By querying relevant data from the sales and transaction databases, I can identify key metrics such as sales volumes, revenue generated, and customer engagement for each promotional period. This analysis allows me to discern which specific AtliQ branded products and promotional strategies garnered notable success, enabling the Sales Director to make data-driven decisions for optimizing future promotional initiatives.
